# Cache-Implementation

In this assignment, we implemented a cache architecture and analyzed the dependency of hit/miss rates on varying block size, cache size, and associativity, examining how these factors affect overall efficiency. This was done as a part of Computer Architecture - Memory Design course in semester 3.
